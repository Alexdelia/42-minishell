launch main and init memory needed (especialy if chained list are used)

while (TRUE)
{
	// wait for user to enter a command using gnl

	pid = fork
	if (pid == -1)
		stop the program
	if (pid != 0)
		wait(NULL); // wait for child to execve the command;
	else
		execve(command, param, envp); // execute the command;
	if (ft_strcmp(command == "exit") == 0)
		break;
}

clean what has been init;

end of program;

Ideas:

at start of prompt:
	- clean screen the first time;
	- type name of prompt (like a colored arrow with the name)

data structure used:
	- could separate each element in chained list or just directly send the whole line
	  enter in the prompt to the child and to the command.
